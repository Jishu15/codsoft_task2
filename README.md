# Personal Portfolio Website
Welcome to my portfolio website! I am a passionate and creative person who loves to learn new skills and showcase my talent. 

Here you can find some of the projects that I have worked on, such as a Calculator 🧮 and a to-do-list 📝 app, as well as my basic programming skills in HTML 🌐, CSS 🎨 and JavaScript ☕. 

I hope you enjoy browsing through my work and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or feedback. 😊😍👍
