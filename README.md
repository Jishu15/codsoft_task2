# Personal Portfolio Website
Welcome to my portfolio website! I am a passionate and creative person who loves to learn new skills and showcase my talent. 

Here you can find some of the projects that I have worked on, such as a Calculator 🧮 and a To-Do-List 📝 app, as well as my basic programming skills in HTML 🌐, CSS 🎨 and JavaScript ☕. 

I hope you enjoy browsing through my work and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or feedback. 😊😍👍



# NOTE!

The To-Do list website mentioned in my portfolio under the "Projects" section is made in collaboration with Riddhiman Dutta - https://github.com/cdnjmusic and therefore it is neither copied nor taken the whole credit of.
